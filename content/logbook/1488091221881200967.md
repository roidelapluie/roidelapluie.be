10 years after I started doing so, I am still installing Linux for close family
and vary close friends.

10 years ago, I used Ubuntu. 5 years ago, Linux Mint. 3 years ago, Ubuntu Gnome.

But yesterday, Ubuntu just let me the choice between a black screen (amdgru-pro
closed source driver) and a 800x600 screen resolution (VESA driver), with a
Radeon RX460 graphic card. I ended up installing Fedora instead of Ubuntu, for
the first time ever. And at the end, I think it will do the job just as well as
Ubuntu Gnome. And the graphics card worked directly!
