The Jenkins Job DSL plugin is really amazing .. for small teams where you can
afford code review and trust people. Because it also allows you to configure
Jenkins without sandbox. Any user can change anything. For that, having the
plugin installed and being able to update jobs or Jenkinsfiles is enough.

e.g. execute the following in Job DSL:

```
import jenkins.model.Jenkins;
Jenkins.instance.setNumExecutors(600)
```
