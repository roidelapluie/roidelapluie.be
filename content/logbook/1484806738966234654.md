In Jenkins Blue ocean every step that is not in a stage or in a stage but
outside parallels will not be displayed. And it is not actively being worked on.
It means that people will need to write very good Jenkinsfiles -- but most of
the people won't. Strange that upstream does not consider this as critical.
I have commented the ticket to add at least a warning when this is the case.
