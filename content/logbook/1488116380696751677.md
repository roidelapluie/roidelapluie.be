Pagure is a great self hosted git repo manager.

With a few missing features to be more adopted:

- Just supports local and OpenID (FAS) authentication
- Does not support private projects

Otherwise, it has lots of great features:

- Pull requests (even from external public git URL's!)
- Issues (With custom fields)
- Built-in documentation management
- Jenkins integration
- Packaged in EPEL

Looks like a lot of useful code... But unfortunately the missing features are
too blocking at the moment to be useful in any of the projects I am involved
in...
