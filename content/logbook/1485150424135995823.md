Pipenv - Joining Virtualenv, Pipfiles, pip in one row -- and creating
Pipfile.lock.

Seems useful. In lots of projects, I have the habit of running always the same
commands -- virtualenv venv; . venv/bin/activate; pip install -r
requirements.txt; pip freeze > requirements.txt.freeze. Simplifying that looks
useful.
