So, this was the [FOSDEM][F] week again. Six days of talk about how we can
improve our daily jobs, and the open-source ecosystem. What makes this week
unique is that the main focus is not around each project, but around the
collaboration between them. Having high level people from the main Open-Source
project in one city, one country, for a couple of days, discussing about
cooperation, is really amazing.
