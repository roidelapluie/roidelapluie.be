The first Open-Source contribution I remember happened on December 2005.
It happened on Gaim, which is now known as [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/).

It was not a big contribution: I did not like the arrows shown when moving
discussion tabs. Those arrows where plain red. I [created new ones][nw] (using The
Gimp), with a gradient. It did not take a long time to make them, but it was
definitively an improvement.

Here it is: ![my first contribution](/images/tb_drag_arrow_up.png)

It was quickly merged (< 2 hours). And it was important for me, because at that
moment I understood that I could improve the tools I was using, and that
everyone would get those improvements. That was the beginning of 12 years
of Open Source contributions.
