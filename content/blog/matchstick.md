I have backed [Matchstick](http://matchstick.tv), the HDMI stick based on [Firefox OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en/firefox/os/).
It is the first crowdfunding project I participate. And I hope it won't be the last one.

There are a few reasons why I have chosen to do so.

The first reason is the open-source part of that project. An open-source software
combined with open-source hardware, that is everything I like. Good philosophy is always a good point.

Next that project is exciting. An easy to use HDMI stick for my TV is something really cool. I do
not have a "smart" TV but still my TV has some HDMI input and USB plugs (to power the stick).

Third part: it is cheap. It worth its 18 USD. I don't even look at opponents price there, because no
opponent is as open-source as this. I even find that the announced market price (25 USD) is acceptable.

Also I am really happy to see an new device that IS NOT run by Android. Android is
too mainstream I think, and even if it is open-source, the Google-way of managing it
is not something I like.

Relatedly to the previous point, it is important that the project is not made by [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org).
Open-Source and standards that are really good are forked and used by third-parties
companies. That is kind of a quality proof.

Now we will see what we will get at the end, if the promises will be fulfilled and how will the stick
behave in real conditions. I also hope that a lot of the apps ecosystem will also be open-source.
I am waiting February to see what's going on and to put some more feedback there.
