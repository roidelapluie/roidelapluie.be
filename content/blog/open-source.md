I see a lot of people working in the Open-Source world, defending the Open-Source and besides that, using a lot of closed source applications.

Each time you run a closed source application, you open a browser with proprietary plugins, you communicate with a closed protocol, it is a defeat for the Open-Source world.

First, what is Open-Source (and for me it is the same as Free Software) about?

It is about *freedoms*.

* Freedom to use
* Freedom to study
* Freedom to modify
* Freedom to share

And guess what? This is the definition of Free Software.

Each proprietary software is taking you one of these freedoms. And it is the same with the closed protocols and formats, of course.

So what are we ready to pay to use a service, to communicate?

Why am I using Open-Source softwares?

* We are part of one big team
* You find help easily
* There is a lot of documentation
* People share about their experience
* You can learn at will
* You are never completely blocked
* New softwares arrive every day
* Code is poetry

Why do I reject closed-source softwares?

* I take care of my freedoms
* I do not like big companies that tell me which software/protocol to use
* I like making choices
* I love applications made by those who use them
