FoxyProxy devs have deployed a new major release of their addon. It ignores
your current config, you need to create a new one. There is no migration path.

Hopefully the new config is still on disk. Simply disable the addon autoupdate
and get the
[4.6.5](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/versions/) release
to get back to work.

I really don't get why the devs have broken that so useful extension...
