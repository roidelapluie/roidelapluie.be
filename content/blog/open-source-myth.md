If you are involved in IT and have some interests in Open-Source software, you
probably have met some projects that claim that they will be Open-Source "one
day".

And guess what? It rarely happens. I would like to clarify some stuff about that
kind of sentences.

### You do not owe us anything

If you build software and you do not want to open-source it, it's fine. I will
not use it, but you are free to do whatever you want to do. I will not contribute
in any way in proprietary software anyway.

Just don't tell you will open source it if you will never.

### You have to respect the licence

If your software is based on copyleft (GPL) work then you have to open source it, and as
soon as you distribute it. That's not your choice then.

### Who would install crappy software?

Reason #1 invoked to not open source software 'yet': the code is not in a published
state, not good-looking, not finished or whatever. Who would then install a software
that the maintainer publicly explain that it is not well coded? And more than that
hides the source code...

The only sensitive thing to do if you really plan to open source your project is
to well.. open source it. Open Sourcing should be more than creating a tarball or
a git repository without development history.
