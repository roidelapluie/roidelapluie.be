I love Open-Source, and the principles attached to it. One of these principle is
the principle of choice:

* The choice of the technology stack
* The choice of the software you use
* The choice of the decisions you take
* The choice of the license you use
* The choice of how you spend your time

Today I would like to focus on the last part. There are so many open source
software around, because every project is organic. Projects come to live, they
have their life and then they die. That typically happens in the IT industry.

Except the last part. Once you deploy a software, you never know who will use it
and until when. It would not be surprise that there would still be a lot of things
running a 2.4 Linux kernel around. Think about all the machines that still run
Windows XP. And all the disconnected machines that still run it.

The main difference in this area between closed source and open source is that as
long as one people will work on it, a project might be forked, get new releases,
and then be used. Even if the project is deprecated, obsolete, or has lost its
user base.

I call that phenomenon a niche. You can live in a niche, spend all your time
on a project. This is your freedom as an open source software user but more
generally your freedom as a human being.

There are a lot of projects that now live in niches:

* [Apache Open-Office](https://www.openoffice.org/)
* [Gnu Social](http://www.gnu.org/software/social/) (Merged with StatusNet)
* [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/)
* [Cobbler](http://cobbler.github.io/)

All of those projects are still alive and they should remind us that we are free.
Free to do what we want in our free time if we believe it is the right thing to do.

An open-source project just needs one person to live.
