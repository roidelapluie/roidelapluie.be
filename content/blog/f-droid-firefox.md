[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) will get a new name - at least on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org). Firefox was alreasy known as [GNU IceCat](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/) and [Iceweasel](https://wiki.debian.org/Iceweasel).

Now F-Droid will have its own rebuild, called [Fennec FDroid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=firefox&fdid=org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid). It removes the proprietary binaries out of the official builds.

F-Droid will eventually remove Firefox out of its package list.
