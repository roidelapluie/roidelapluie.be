[Google](http://google-opensource.blogspot.be/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) is [shutting down Google Code](http://google-opensource.blogspot.be/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html). It was quite expected that it would join the Google graveyard. It was a cool service but the UI never got a lot of attention. Parsing a source tree or looking at issues was like traveling back in 2006.

This should however be a reminder that all of these platforms (Google Code, Github, Bitbucket) are centralized and closed-source. Even if Github loves Open-Source, and is loved by the Open-Source community, it is a totally closed platform.

Which alternatives do you have them if you want to self-host your repositories? A bunch of them actually. The most bling-bling one being [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/). You also have Gitorious, Gitblit, Gitlist, ... There are a huge number of them. There are even complete forges out there like [CodingTeam](http://codingteam.net/project/codingteam).

The real question is how to combine visibility and freedom? My guess is that will only be possible with self-hosted projects being mirrored on upstream sites. Your code continues to be free, and hosted in several places.

I personally use Github because there are a lot of people there. A project that is not on Github is even a python project or a dead project, in most of the cases. Sourceforge is only the place to download tarballs and Google Code was not really used anymore.

Long live GitHub, GitLab and every other alternative places where we will put our code and make it live. Long live git. And thanks Google Code.
