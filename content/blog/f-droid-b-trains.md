I have discovered that [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) contains [BeTrains](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=tof.cv.mpp), an open-source android tool to get data like timetables from the Belgian national railway company. Let's take some time to explain you that in details.

### What is [F-droid](https://f-droid.org)?

It is a repository for Android. It contains a lot of different application, that have one thing in common: they are all open-source.

There is of course one client that you can install on your android device to browse the catalogue and download/update your applications.

There is a bunch of good things with the repository and its application:

* It contains only open-source softwares
* There are almost no ads in the packages; so a lot of them does not require any permissions
* It warns you of an application uses or promotes closed-source services
* You have a clear view of the license and where you can find the source code
* You can download the `.apk` files on the website
* You get notifications when updates are available

The first point makes that very cool, the other points are bonus ;-)


### What is [BeTrains](https://github.com/iRail/BeTrains-for-Android)?

It is a modern, powerful application to get timetables, traffic issues and much more data about the trains in Belgium. It is a user-friendly alternative to the closed-source official client offered by the Belgian national railway company.

It is built on top of the [iRail API](http://project.irail.be/wiki/API/APIv1), a project that offers a RESTful API around the train informations in Belgium. It is not built by NMBS/SNCB but by a bunch of people that like open data.

### Conclusion

There are a lot of useful softwares in F-Droid, but BeTrains is an important one because it offers access to data that really matters in everyday life. It is an open-source software that I have used in the past and I am very happy that it is now available on my favourite android repository.
