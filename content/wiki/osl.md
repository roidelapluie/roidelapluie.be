I am a true defender of Open-Source software. I have been using them since 10
years, almost exclusively. It lasts for a so long time that I the way I use
my computer has grown with that fact built in.

Open-Source softwares come in all quality, with small, large or no community.
When I pick an Open-Source software, I have a few criterias: privacy, quality,
community, security. All of that comes in my mind. And for 95% of the things I
want to do, there is a nice Open-Source software that fits my need.

There is still 5%. In those 5%, 4 are stuff that I reconsider and decide not to
do, or to do them in a different way. Because if it really requires a proprietary
software then maybe it is not so important to me.

The last 1% is the subject of this page: I use some proprietary software to achieve
some very specific tasks. And I want to explain why I have decided to use them.

Number of items in the list: 1.

### Widevine Content Decryption Module plugin

I use that proprietary plugin to access Netflix. There is no Open-Source alternative
to use Netflix. The reason why I decided to use that service is that it is cheap and
it works on Linux without efforts. That plugin is easy to install and behind it
there is a HTML5 interface.

Netflix made a lot of efforts to come to Belgium and to serve content that
I can watch legally. No one could offer such a good offer before them, and most
of the others do not care about Linux. So Netflix made half the way to me, and I
decided that I would go the other half by installing the Widevine plugin.
